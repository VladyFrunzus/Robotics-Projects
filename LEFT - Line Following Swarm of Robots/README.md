This project is one of the several robotics projects I did during my semester at Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya, Barcelona.
The enviroment and code were programmed and simulated using WeBots, while the electronics were tackled from the theorical point of view.

There are 2 things contained here:

1. "LEFT_e-puck_control" - A folder containing all the files of the WeBots project. This contains the code which describes the logic of the swarm's movement.

2. "LEFT Project Proposal.pdf" - A proposal which tackles the electronics and physical robot building of the project.
