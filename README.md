# Robotics-Projects
This repository contains several robotics projects which I did while being at Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya, Barcelona. 

There are 4 projects in total:

- Two of the projects (Square Path and START specifically) were coded on and for robotbenchmark.net, so that is why the code is written in .txt files. Square Path is a basic line following program, while START is a more complex obstacle-avoiding algorithm. My profile link for robotbenchmark.net is: https://robotbenchmark.net/vladimirfrunza.
  
- The LEFT project tackles a swarm of line-following robots, both from the electronics and coding points of view.
  
- The MOM project proposes a simple design for a Modular Microrobot, which is intended for use in swarm robotics.
